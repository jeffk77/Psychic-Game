Assignment #3 - U of T Bootcamp


# Description:

The psychic game is designed to accept user input of "letter" string guesses, to match a random computer choice. A "win" is scored if the user guesses the computer's choice within 10 turns. Losses are recorded after 10 failed attempts to guess. After each round, the game resets.
